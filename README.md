The app is a simple hello world program that begins with a black screen saying "Goodbye World". Pressing the button will change it to "Hello World" with a white background and black text. Each time you press the button, it will toggle between these two screens. I knew I wanted to add toggle functionality to the button, so I thought of switching between hello and goodbye world.
